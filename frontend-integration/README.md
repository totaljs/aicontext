# Total.js Backend — Frontend Integration Guide

A complete, platform-agnostic reference for integrating any frontend or mobile client with a **Total.js API Routing** backend.

If you are changing the **backend**, stop and read [../totaljs/architecture.md](../totaljs/architecture.md). This folder is the client contract. It does not authorize Express-style backend structure.

This guide stack is designed to be reused across projects. Replace `totaljsbackend.com` with your actual backend URL and substitute example resource names (`items`, `posts`, `users`) with your own domain schemas.

## The three facts you need to know first

```
1. Every API call is:   POST https://totaljsbackend.com/api/  (or the path declared by NEWACTION route)
2. Every request body:  { "schema": "Namespace|action[?params]", "data": { ... } }
3. Every auth:          x-token: <session_token>  (header, injected globally)
```

That is the entire surface area of a Total.js API Routing backend from the client's perspective.

## Reading order for new developers

1. **01** — understand the routing model before writing a single line of code
2. **02** — internalize the exact wire format
3. **03** — implement auth before anything else
4. **05** — understand the recommended client architecture
5. **07** for React Native — implement environment config, auth hydration, anonymous schemas, uploads
6. **Your platform guide** (06, 07, or 08) — copy the boilerplate, adapt to your domain
7. **04** — reference when you need to know how a schema should be named or structured
